This is a basic django web application and aims to take an audio input from the user and converts into text format. Additional software (ffmpeg) available at https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows. The ffmpeg software is required in this project because it handles the conversion of audio files from the webm format to the wav format. This conversion is necessary because the speech_recognition library used for transcribing the audio to text requires audio input in specific formats such as WAV, AIFF, or FLAC.
